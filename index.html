							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My name is Glen Bonham. I am a student at RMIT Online studying my Bachelor of IT. I have been a Heavy Vehicle Mechanic (Diesel Mechanic) for 20 years and have decided on a career change. 
							I have always had a love for the back-end of IT. I love programming code and creating programs that make life easier. 
							I am Australian born and bred, I love my country and want to help make it a better place to live. Until starting study at the University level my previous education was the Higher School Certificate. 
							Also, I have two trade certificate qualifications. Something that not everyone knows about me is that I have had 6 hand surgeries due to injuries I have sustained through working 
							in my current profession. </p>
							
							<p>In my spare time I am a keen golfer. I also like to create projects for myself to complete, some are in the garage and some are at the computer screen. 
							I like to practice my coding skills by writing dummy programs and testing them. When I feel I need a break from the screens, I like to make and repair things. 
							Some are automotive projects but I also enjoy woodworking, it is very rewarding to start with a pile of timber and creating something either functional
							or pleasing to look at.</p>


							<p>My interest in IT came from playing around with different programming languages and seeing what they could do. There are thousands of apps that help make life easier and automate some tasks. 
							However, in my experience a lot of these apps have certain functionalities that are either missing or could be improved. 
							I would like to help rectify this by writing my own programs and apps to fill in the blanks that other applications are lacking.</p> 

 

							<p>I chose RMIT because I have studied with them before. A few years ago, I was building websites and found there was a bit of a gap in the functionality of some website builders. 
							This drove me to want to learn how to do the coding myself. Upon searching around to find the ideal way to learn how to code, I came across an online university option. 
							This was very appealing to me as I have a thirst for knowledge, it would also be a better recognized qualification than just learning from a “free” online course when I go on to changing careers.</p>

 

							<p>During my studies with RMIT I expect that I will learn many different skills that will help me into the future. Such things as coding, 
							working in an office environment as well as collaborating which is a vital part of working on various IT projects. </p>

										<img src="images/job.PNG" alt=""/></a> </span><br><br>
										
									<p>This job is appealing to me because it is developing applications for both web and mobile based platforms. The applications are designed to help the aged and disability heath care sectors. 
									Developing these kinds of applications is exactly why I want to get into the world of IT.  
									This position requires the use of particular disciplines of coding to fulfil the client's needs. Things like HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL as well as Java Script and jQuery.  </p>
									<p>I currently have some experience in a broad range of programming languages, these include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>HTML</li>
									<li>PHP</li>
									<li>CSS</li>
									<li>Java</li>
									<li>Python</li>
								</ul>
							<p>By no means do I believe that I am ready for this role. I have limited knowledge and experience writing code in these diciplines. However, that is why I chose to 
							study at RMIT so I can gain these skills and more.</p>

										<h2>Learning Style</h2>

											<strong><h3>Assertive Mediator </h3></strong>
											<p>I am an assertive mediator according to 16 personalities. I believe that is due to my inquisitive nature. 
											I don’t need or want to have power or control over any person or situation. I would rather discuss all possibilities and get everyone’s 
											ideas and feedback on a certain issue before making an informed decision. These traits would be beneficial in a team environment to not try and take control, 
											but to explore every possible option. Help others talk through their thoughts and come to a positive resolution for the project and everyone involved. </p>
											
											<strong><h3>Visual Learning Style</h3></strong>
											
											<p>After conducting two separate leaning style tests online the results both came back the same. According to the results my learning style is Visual. 
											The results just confirmed what I had already believed about my learning style. I prefer to have things in front of me that I can see to help me with the taking in of information. 
											When in a team, this is beneficial to know up front. Knowing this information more of a focus can be put around visual aids and diagrams to help with the 
											learning process and putting my ideas across. The other tests were found at the sites below.</p>

										<h2>Projects</h2>
										
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<h3>Overview</h3>
										<p>My project is to design an application that can tell if you are intoxicated and locks your phone. 
										The app would take a scan your face and even produce some logical questions that you would have answer correctly within 
										a set amount of time in order to make calls or send messages. Of course, you would still be able to make emergency calls, 
										but certain phone numbers would be blocked. This would include social media apps, to prevent you from posting things that you might regret in the morning. </p>
										
										<h3>Motivation</h3>
										<p>The motivation for an app like this is obvious. Most people have had a moment of weakness while they are out celebrating. 
										We have all heard about people that have decided that after 5+ hours of solid drinking and partying that now would be a good time to call their ex! 
										If not calling/ messaging someone they probably shouldn’t, the other problem is that social media is always open. 
										Today apps like Facebook are so widely used that even prospective employers check your social media pages when you are applying for a job. 
										There is definitely a market for this kind of app, when researching I found that there are over four million results when searching online for this kind of app. 
										While there are some apps already out there for this kind of thing, they are quite new and still have a lot of bugs.
										Also there are ways to get around the program, these issues are what I am aiming to address.</p>
										
										<h3>Project Description</h3>
										<p>To build this app there would be a need for multiple checks. It would need to have face recognition software incorporated, to stop you from getting someone else 
										to unlock your phone for you. The user would take a photo of themselves before commencing drinking and then one when they are trying to use their phone the software 
										would compare the two photos. Determine whether you were in fact intoxicated and prevent you from using the device until you could show that you were no longer in that state. 
										The program would also randomly generate some logical questions that a person in a good state of mind would be able to answer easily. These questions would have a time limit in 
										which you could answer them. If these questions or the photo check was failed, then you would not be able to try again for one hour. </p> 

										<p>It would also be linked to your social accounts so assuming these checks were failed your friends would not be able to tag you in their posts. 
										This would require you to link your social accounts to the app, but if you have ever been embarrassed by this kind of behavior then you would not 
										hesitate to sync everything up while you are sober. </p> 

										<p>As well as comparing your two photos, the facial recognition software would check for certain markers in your facial features. 
										These markers would be pre-programmed into the software from known intoxicated photos. Markers that a police officer or security guard would look for when 
										determining whether you are intoxicated. Once intoxication has been detected in the user, the app could contact someone that you have pre-programmed into the database. 
										Notifying that person, possibly a best friend, that you are trying to access your phone when you probably shouldn’t be. That person can then contact you and stop you from 
										potentially doing something that you would regret in the morning. </p> 

										<p>You would be able to receive calls and reply to messages, just not initiate the contact. Of course, you would be able to contact emergency services if you needed 
										to even after failing the checks. Two other emergency numbers would be able to be contacted. This would have to be nominated at the beginning of the night while you are coherent. 
										All other contacts would be blocked until the next day or when you can pass the checks again. This would disable the app until you used it the next time. This will help you to keep 
										your dignity in-tact and prevent any unacceptable post/ photos of you being circulated around your social circles and the internet. Keeping your professional life safe from a judgemental
										emploer all from simply having a fun night out. </p> 
										
										<h3>Tools</h3>
										<p>. First thing you would need is an app making tool like Buildfire or the iBuildApp to name a few. There are many free sites on the internet that would allow you 
										to build the basics of an app. This would allow you to build the foundation. However, with the kind of technology needed to make this app work you would need a good 
										programmer to fill in the gaps. Lots of research on the markers that would constitute an intoxicated person and apply them to the photos that are taken. The app would 
										require permissions both from social platforms as well as your phone itself. </p> 
										
										<h3>Skills Required</h3>
										<p> As mentioned before, the main skills required for this project would be a very good and accomplished programmer. Someone who knows not only how to build an app, 
										but someone who knows how to work with facial recognition software and manipulate it. Comparing photos to others and to the markers that were mentioned earlier. 
										There would need to be the ability to deploy this program once written. The programmer would be very easy to find, as there are many of great programmers out there many of whom have 
										their own projects that they work on in their spare time. </p> 
										
										<h3>Outcome</h3>
										<p> Once successful, this kind of program as an app will be a very powerful tool to those who want to enjoy themselves and feel safe. You will no longer be able to access the 
										contacts that you shouldn't be while you shouldn't be. If you are one of those people who “drunk dial” people, then this will be a great innovation. It has happened to everyone 
										at some point, and this app would stop it from happening. Allowing you to go out and enjoy yourself without fear of repercussions either professionally or personally. </p>
